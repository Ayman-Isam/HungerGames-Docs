In the plugin, signs are used to display information about the different arena worlds. These signs also allow players to interact with them to join specific arenas. The `/hg setsigns` command is used to set up these signs automatically.

## **Setting Up Signs**

### **Step 1: Place Signs**
Place signs equal to the number of arena worlds side by side on a wall or on the ground. Ensure they are placed side by side. Signs include standing signs, wall signs, and hanging signs.

### **Step 2: Set Signs**
Go to the leftmost sign and run the command `/hg setsign`. This command will automatically set up the signs for all the arena worlds. The signs will display the name of the arena world, the number of players in the arena, and the status of the arena. If you get error messages informing you why the signs could not be set up, ensure that the signs are placed correctly and try again.

### **Step 3: Verify Signs**
Check that the signs teleport players to the correct arena world when clicked. Also ensure that the correct information is displayed on the signs. If the number of players is incorrect, it may be because the world files have not been loaded yet. To fix this, simply just click on the sign to join the arena and the number will be updated.

## **Next Steps**
After setting up the signs, you are now ready to start the game.
